# Capstone Planning - React
## Political Contribution API Web App
#### _Andrew Lupton, 7/13/2018_

## Project Description

I propose to develop a web app that displays api data for political contributions and/or lobbyist-to-politician relationships, using the React library. Minimum features that I want to meet are as follows: a) retrieve api data, b) display api data in a visually interesting and dynamic manner, and c) manage state with Redux store.

If the MVP is met, I propose allowing a user to input additional data into the app as it becomes available. Currently, I've yet to identify the api that I'll be using for the project. Similarly, I've yet to determine the exact tech stack that I'll utilize to make the app performant. Additional planning notes will be posted here as I continue to develop the app concept.
